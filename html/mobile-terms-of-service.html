<h1><span style="font-family: Arial;">Mobile Terms of Service</span></h1>
  <h2><span style="font-family: Arial;">Gallo Fino Brand LLC</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Last updated: Feb. 12, 2023</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Gallo Fino Brand LLC mobile message service (the "Service") is operated by Gallo Fino Brand LLC
  (“Gallo Fino Brand LLC”, “we”, or “us”). Your use of the Service constitutes your agreement to these terms and
  conditions (“Mobile Terms”). We may modify or cancel the Service or any of its features without notice. To the extent
  permitted by applicable law, we may also modify these Mobile Terms at any time and your continued use of the Service
  following the effective date of any such changes shall constitute your acceptance of such changes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">By consenting to Gallo Fino Brand LLC’s SMS/text messaging service, you agree to receive recurring SMS/text messages
  from and on behalf of Gallo Fino Brand LLC through your wireless provider to the mobile number you provided, even if
  your mobile number is registered on any state or federal Do Not Call list. Text messages may be sent using an
  automatic telephone dialing system or other technology. Service-related messages may include
  updates, alerts, and information (e.g., order updates, account alerts, etc.). Promotional messages may
  include promotions, specials, and other marketing offers (e.g., cart reminders).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">You understand that you do not have to sign up for this program in order to make any purchases, and your consent is
  not a condition of any purchase with Gallo Fino Brand LLC. Your participation in this program is completely voluntary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">We do not charge for the Service, but you are responsible for all charges and fees associated with text messaging
  imposed by your wireless provider. Message frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. Check your mobile plan
  and contact your wireless provider for details. You are solely responsible for all charges related to SMS/text
  messages, including charges from your wireless provider.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">You may opt-out of the Service at any time. Text the single keyword command STOP to +18336850156 or click
  the unsubscribe link (where available) in any text message to cancel. You'll receive a one-time opt-out confirmation
  text message. No further messages will be sent to your mobile device, unless initiated by you. If you have subscribed
  to other Gallo Fino Brand LLC mobile message programs and wish to cancel, except where applicable law requires
  otherwise, you will need to opt out separately from those programs by following the instructions provided in their
  respective mobile terms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">For Service support or assistance, text HELP to +18336850156 or email <a href="../html/mailto:gallofinobrand@gmail.com.html">gallofinobrand@gmail.com</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">We may change any short code or telephone number we use to operate the Service at any time and will notify you of
  these changes. You acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP or HELP requests, you send to a short code or
  telephone number we have changed may not be received and we will not be responsible for honoring requests made in
  such messages.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">The wireless carriers supported by the Service are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages. You agree to
  provide us with a valid mobile number. If you get a new mobile number, you will need to sign up for the program with
  your new number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that we will not be liable for failed, delayed, or misdirected
  delivery of any information sent through the Service, any errors in such information, and/or any action you may or
  may not take in reliance on the information or Service.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial;">We respect your right to privacy. To see how we collect and use your personal information, please see our <a href="../html/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Notice</a>.</span></p>
